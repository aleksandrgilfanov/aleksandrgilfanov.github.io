[Me](https://github.com/aleksandrgilfanov) and
[Aleksandr Karabatov](https://github.com/elektron314) are making some fun
every week, we are making track as a challenge. Each one has only one hour to
make a track. This track should be made with using only two samples. One sample
is recorded by me, another by him. You are not limited by anything: record
your environment with your's iphone mic, record synth, process it with effects etc.
